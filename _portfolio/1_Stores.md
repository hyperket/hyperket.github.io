With the use of the Store System u can place a store made with out CCK into the world. As long as the store fits the gideline there is no limit on what kind of store you can make, whether it be a store front for actual goods or just a virtual bar to chill with friends in its completely up to you.

if a store is not enough for you we also allow custom worlds through requests, again what you use the world for is upto you.

We are always looking for more fetures to add to the CCK so if you feel like something is missing let use know we might just add it.
